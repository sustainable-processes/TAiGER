TAiGER is a python-based **Tool for Automated Generation of Mechanistic Reactor Models**. It is designed to generate accurate mechanistic reactor models from experimental concentration data of the given reactor. At the core of this workflow, a reinforcement learning agent assembles an interpretable reactor model from building blocks organized in an ontological database. Using iterative parameter estimation, the generated candidate model is fitted to experimental data and improved if necessary in a postprocessing step. 

TAiGER is under active development in the [Sustainable Reaction Engineering Group](https://www.lapkingroup.com/) at the University of Cambridge.
